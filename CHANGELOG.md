- ListView for the course output. [@Brandon-Watkins](https://github.com/Brandon-Watkins)
- Event handlers (exit, button clicks, adding a course). [@Brandon-Watkins](https://github.com/Brandon-Watkins)
- Added esc and enter shortcuts to the create course and exit buttons. Unfortunately this doesn’t work if you’ve clicked on an item in the ListView output. [@Brandon-Watkins](https://github.com/Brandon-Watkins)
- Sorted the output to add some organization. [@Brandon-Watkins](https://github.com/Brandon-Watkins)
